    </h1>
    </p>
    <h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems and machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence to complete. These tasks may include learning, problem-solving, understanding human speech, recognizing images, decision-making, and natural language processing. AI technologies are designed to mimic human cognition and behavior, allowing machines to adapt and improve their performance over time.

        <dd> Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. It allows systems to improve their performance over time as they gather more data and experience.

    <h3>
        <dd> Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. The primary goal of NLP is to bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding, making it easier for humans to interact with computers using natural language.

        <dd>Computer Vision (CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual data from the world, such as images and videos. It aims to simulate and replicate human visual perception and understanding, allowing machines to analyze, process, and derive meaning from visual information.
